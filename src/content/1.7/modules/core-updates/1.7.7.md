## New hooks

The following hooks have been added:

- displayAdditionalCustomerAddressFields
- displayFooterCategory
- actionAdminAdminPreferencesControllerPostProcessBefore
- actionAdminLoginControllerBefore
- actionAdminLoginControllerLoginBefore
- actionAdminLoginControllerLoginAfter
- actionAdminLoginControllerForgotBefore
- actionAdminLoginControllerForgotAfter
- actionAdminLoginControllerResetBefore
- actionAdminLoginControllerResetAfter

### Changes in AdminController hooks

In Pull Request [#19712](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/19712) hooks `displayBackOfficeTop` and `displayBackOfficeHeader` calls have been moved from `AdminController::init()` to `AdminController::initHeader()`.

However in certain situations, these hooks were the only extension points available. To overcome this, the Pull Request [#21435](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/21435) introduced new hooks in `AdminController::init()` as well as in other abstract Controller classes:
- actionFrontControllerInitBefore
- actionFrontControllerInitAfter
- actionAdminControllerInitBefore
- actionAdminControllerInitAfter
- actionControllerInitAfter
- actionControllerInitBefore

The hook actionFrontControllerAfterInit has been removed (an alias is still there to avoid BC break).

## Database table charset updated

All database tables have been switched to the utf8mb4 charset in order to provide support for emojis.

Because of this, the size for some indexes have been reduced to `191`:

- Field `alias` in `alias` table
- Field `slug` in `authorization_role` table
- Field `module` in `module_preference` table
- Field `module` in `tab_module_preference` table
- Field `cache_id` in `smarty_lazy_cache` table

## Updated jQuery to latest version

jQuery has been updated to 3.4.1 in Back office (up from 1.11 in legacy pages) and Core theme (up from 2.1.4).

**jQuery has changed a lot between v1.11 / v2.1.4 and v3.4.1. This is why [jquery migrate](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate) was enabled in order to provide a layer of compatibility, but this does not preserve all jQuery capabilities for such old versions.**

Modules relying on these old capabilities may experience problems, including but not limited to:

* `context` property has been removed
* Using `dataType` in an ajax request won't trigger the `success` / `done` methods if the type of content returned does not match
* [`jQuery.attr()` behavior has evolved](https://api.jquery.com/attr/), most of the time, you should use `jQuery.prop()` instead. 


## Order view page layout modifications

In this version the order page has been migrated with Symfony. We used this migration as an opportunity to improve the page layout to meet the merchants' needs.
You can see a representation of these new hooks in the page here:

{{< figure src="../img/order-view-page-hooks.jpg" title="Order view page hooks layout" >}}


### Modified hooks

The following hooks **have been moved** and have new names. Even though they are very similar to their former equivalents the layout has changed and thus the modules need to adapt their rendering.

Removed hook                                                           | New hook                        | Modification
---------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**displayAdminOrderRight**                                             | **displayAdminOrderSideBottom** | It is now displayed on the **left** which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position, since the layout is completely different it has no alias
**displayAdminOrderLeft**                                              | **displayAdminOrderMainBottom** | It is now displayed on the **right** which is why it was renamed based on its context not its position, since the layout is completely different it has no alias
**displayAdminOrderTabOrder** and **displayAdminOrderTabShip**         | **displayAdminOrderTabLink**    | Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab links the order view page, it only has the *id_order* as a parameter
**displayAdminOrderContentOrder** and **displayAdminOrderContentShip** | **displayAdminOrderTabContent** | Both hooks are now combined in a single generic hook that allows you to include tab contents the order view page, it only has the *id_order* as a parameter

These hooks have been aliased, although we recommend migrating to the new hooks and check that it integrates correctly with the new layout:

Deprecated hook                   | New aliased hook          | Modification
--------------------------------- |:------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**displayBackOfficeOrderActions** | **displayAdminOrderSide** | Although it has been aliased for convenience, the new hook is not displayed at the same place at all (it is now in the side column), so we suggest to verify how your code integrates into the new layout. If you need to add action buttons, use the new **actionGetAdminOrderButtons** hook
**displayInvoice**                | **displayAdminOrderTop**  | This hook has the same placement and parameters

These hooks have been added on the order view page:

New hook                       | Function
------------------------------ |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**displayAdminOrderSide**      | It is displayed in the side column (similar to displayAdminOrderSideBottom) but right under the customer view
**displayAdminOrderMain**      | It is displayed in the side column (similar to displayAdminOrderMainBottom) but right under the details view
**actionGetAdminOrderButtons** | It is used to build a collection of buttons in the order thanks to an `ActionsBarButtonsCollection` which is automatically rendered

These hooks have been added on the order list page:

New hook                       | Function
------------------------------ |:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**displayOrderPreview**      | It is displayed at the bottom of the order's preview on the order's listing page.


## Product cover

A major bug has been fixed in product listing, for products with combinations the image displayed was the first one from the default combination, and the cover was ignored. This behaviour has been fixed but in order to allow modules to override this cover a new `cover_image_id` has been introduced.
This image ID is then used to populate the `product.cover` field usable in the templates, if you want the default image for the combination (which was the previous behaviour) you can use the new `product.default_image` field.

{{% notice warning %}}
If your theme overrides some of the `classic` theme templates and uses the `$product.cover` property you should check that it still matches the expected behaviour, especially in the `themes/classic/templates/catalog/_partials/product-cover-thumbnails.tpl` used in the product page where `$product.default_image` should be used.

You can read this FAQ if you want to know [how to override the Product cover]({{< ref "1.7/faq/product#product-cover" >}}).

## Product - quick view mode

In previous 1.7 versions if you wanted to check whether people are displaying product page using quick view, in a module hooked into `displayProductAdditionalInfo`, you could use this code:

`$quickView = (Tools::getValue('action') == 'quickview)`

From v1.7.7 due to changes related to dynamic refresh of `displayProductAdditionalInfo` in quick view modal, it's no longer possible to do that this way.

From now on, you can always ask `ProductController` to tell you if customer is using quick view, using this code:

```php
if ($this->context->controller instanceof ProductController && $this->context->controller->isQuickView()) {
    // We're in quick view mode
}
```

or directly in `.tpl` file:

```smarty
{if $page.page_name == 'product' && Context::getContext()->controller->isQuickView()}
    We're in quick view mode for {$product.id_product} and attribute {$product.id_product_attribute}
{/if}
```

## Modern Tabs for modern modules

Modern modules that use Symfony controller and routing can now use the `$tabs` property in their module class to [automatically register Tabs in the BackOffice menu]({{< ref "1.7/modules/concepts/controllers/admin-controllers/tabs#automatic-tab-registration" >}}).

Also new in this version, when a module is enabled/disabled all its related [Tab links are automatically shown/hidden]({{< ref "1.7/modules/concepts/controllers/admin-controllers/tabs#automatic-hiding-of-disabled-modules" >}}).

## Default mail method does not use the `mail()` function anymore

The `mail()` function is not used anymore [for security reasons](https://github.com/swiftmailer/swiftmailer/issues/866#issuecomment-289291228).
Instead, `/usr/sbin/sendmail` is now the default way of sending mails.
{{% notice warning %}}
You should check that your server environment is configured to allow this use or change this setting in **Configure** > **Advanced Parameters** > **E-mail** by another sending method like SMTP.
{{% /notice %}}
