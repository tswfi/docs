# Prestashop multistore feature

PrestaShop allows you to manage multiple stores in a single PrestaShop instance: this feature is called multistore.

When shop administrator turns on the Multistore option, he can configure different shops powered by the software.
Moreover the Back Office interface is modified to allow Back Office users to manage shop settings and content, either for all shops, for a group of shop or for a single shop.
