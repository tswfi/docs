      <description>Preliminary tasks Before you can start your build, you must make sure that the project is ready to be built.
1. Create the new version in Addons Marketplace and update native module compatibility This step requires special rights.
Ask a maintainer from the PrestaShop Company with administrative rights on the Addons Marketplace to perform this step.
 This only needs to be done once per release.
(i.e. if done for a beta, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be performed again for the final release).</description>

      <description>Release the version publicly Once the QA team has greenlighted your build, you can move forward with the public release.
Make certain you have go for publish! Also, avoid starting this process after 4 PM or on a Friday. 1. Merge security PRs on GitHub If there are unmerged security PRs:
 Merge them on GitHub and publishing their security advisories. Rebase the local build branch that you created on the previous step to remove the merge commits from the security PRs you merged manually before.</description>
