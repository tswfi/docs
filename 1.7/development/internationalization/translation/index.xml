      <description>Introduction to translation At its core, translation consists in programmatically transforming a wording into its equivalent in a target language, using a translation dictionary. If the loaded dictionary is in Spanish, the output will be in Spanish.
Vocabulary Before you begin working with translations, you should get familiarized with the following concepts:
 Wording (or &amp;ldquo;message&amp;rdquo;) An abstraction of a phrase that will be translated to any given language. It&amp;rsquo;s usually written as plain English, in order to make it easier to understand.</description>

      <description>Translation Domains Sometimes wordings may seem vague when seen out of context. For example, &amp;ldquo;Delete&amp;rdquo;. Just like that, we can imagine what is it used for, but we don&amp;rsquo;t really have much information about it. What are we deleting? From a translator standpoint, this is very hard, because not only do we not know where it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be used, but it could be used in several places, with different meanings.</description>

      <description>Using the Translator to translate wordings This section provides an quick reference on how to use the Translator. For more information, read Symfony&amp;rsquo;s documentation on Using the Translator. PHP files To translate wordings in PHP files, you first need an instance of the Translator service (explained below). Then, you can use the trans() method to translate your wording:
&amp;lt;?php echo $translator-&amp;gt;trans(&amp;#39;This product is no longer available.&amp;#39;, [], &amp;#39;Shop.Notifications.Error&amp;#39;); The trans() method takes three arguments:</description>

      <description>Native module translation To find out the basics of module translation, read Module Translation. In PrestaShop lingo, &amp;ldquo;native modules&amp;rdquo; refers to all the modules that are bundled and distributed with the Core.
In difference with 3rd party modules, native modules&#39; translation catalogues are distributed with the Core itself. Thanks to this, Native modules are translated using the New translation system since 1.7.0.</description>

      <description>Translation tips and tricks Adding new wordings Wordings for the Core and Native modules can only be translated if they are declared in PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s default translation catalogue. Therefore, whenever a new wording is added to the core or to a native module, it must be added to the default catalogue as well.
Normally you would have to manually add each wording the appropriate default catalogue files (located in the app/Resources/translations/default folder).</description>
